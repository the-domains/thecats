  February 11, 2015 marks five years in space for NASA's Solar Dynamics
  Observatory, which provides incredibly detailed images of the whole sun 24
  hours a day. Capturing an image more than once per second, SDO has provided an
  unprecedentedly clear picture of how massive explosions on the sun grow and
  erupt ever since its launch on Feb.
